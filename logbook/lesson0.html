                  <li>Web Design Concepts 
                      <ul>
                          <li><b>Atomic Design</b>:
                              <ul>
                                  <li>Atomic Design<b> </b>breaks down a website&#39;s design into smaller, reusable components, similar to how chemistry breaks matter into atoms, molecules, and organisms.  
                                      <ul>
                                          <li><b>Atoms:</b> UI elements that can’t be broken down any further and serve as the elemental  building blocks of an interface.</li>
                                          <li><b>Molecules:</b> Groups of atoms working together, like a search form that combines a button, an input field, and a label.  </li>
                                          <li><b>Organisms:</b> More complex components composed of multiple molecules and atoms, such as a website’s header or footer.</li>
                                          <li><b>Templates:</b> Combine organisms and other elements. Define the overall layout of a page.</li>
                                          <li><b>Pages:</b> Final, fully designed web pages where content is populated within the templates.</li>
                                      </ul>
                                  </li>
                              </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>Core web technologies:
                              <ul>
                                  <li>Using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b>, the huge part of the website&#39;s frontend part - if not the entire - can be built: 
                                      <ul>
                                          <li><b>HTML (Structure):</b> The &quot;layout&quot; or structure of the webpage, like the frame of a car, defines the basic elements of the page such as headings, paragraphs, and images.</li>
                                          <li><b>CSS (Style):</b> CSS controls the visual presentation ‒ determines how the HTML elements look (colors, fonts, spacing) ‒ like the color and design of the car.</li>
                                          <li><b>JavaScript (Functionality):</b> JavaScript adds interactive behavior and functionality to the webpage, much like how an engine gives a car its movement.</li>
                                      </ul>
                                  </li>
                              </ul>
                          </li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Lesson summary: 
                      <ul>
                          <li>In today&#39;s class, we learnt about the content of the course as well as some rules we must follow to be able to successfully complete the course. Additionally, we also started learning about web development including some web design concepts and some tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also got to know about the course&#39;s TA, and websites she recommended to check out were really interesting beneficial. I think everything taught in the class was understandable, but I believe more further discussions regarding the LogBook, and the Media Critique Presentation and Report would be fruitful for us.</li>
